# XeniaOS
## Fedora Bootc / Niri / Noctalia / Xenia / Gaming On Linux

This is an opinionated gaming-oriented bootc image (currently) based off Zirconium adding gaming defaults and packages.
And of course, featuring [Xenia the fox](https://xenia.efi.pages.gay/) in theming.

It can be used by first installing [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) (or any related Bootc image) and rebasing with command:
`sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/xeniameraki/XeniaOS`

The project is in its infancy, I would not use this for any serious work/use for right now.

Developers can currently most easily be reached in the [Zirconium Discord](https://discord.gg/mmgNQpxwhW)

Our project is unsupported and unaffiliated (currently) with: CachyOS, Bazzite, Bootcrew, Zirconium, Fedora.
