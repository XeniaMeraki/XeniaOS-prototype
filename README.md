<img src="[https://github.com/favicon.ico](https://github.com/XeniaMeraki/XeniaOS/blob/main/system_files/usr/share/XeniaOS/xenia-logo.png)" width="300">

This is an opinionated gaming-oriented bootc image (currently) based off [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) adding gaming defaults and packages.
And of course, featuring [Xenia the fox](https://xenia.efi.pages.gay/) in theming.


It can be used by first installing [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) (or any related Bootc image) and rebasing with command:


`sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/xeniameraki/xeniaos`


## Featuressss


-Linux/Atomic Fedora


-Niri


-Noctalia/Quickshell


-CachyOS Kernel


-Steam preinstalled


-Content creator oriented flatpaks set preinstalled


The project is in its infancy, I would not use this for any serious work/use for right now.
